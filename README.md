# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe program

V 1.2.1 Adjusted code to reduce redundancy and lag.

V 1.2 Have fully functional "smart" AI to play against. Also, installed a drop down menu that will allow the player to select between a random AI, a smart AI, and an AI that is 50% random.

V 1.1.2 Minor updates.

V 1.1.1 Updated code to reduce redundancy as well as added comments to clarify code. Also removed unnecessary function loadBoard.

V 1.1 Created a rudimentary AI that randomly selects positions on the game board after "thinking" first.

V 1.0 By default, the board starts on X's turn.  As players select spaces to play, the program changes turns as well as checks conditions after each turn to see if the game has been won or if there is a tie.  When the game is won or tied, the board is turned off and no longer playable until the game board is reset by the user.

No AI functionality as of yet.
